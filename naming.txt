Notes on file/class naming:

When a class name is a common name (e.g. Matrix), capital letter 'T' is prepended.
For consistency, all shape classes in AnalyticGeometry should begin with 'T'.

A header ends in .h if it is considered a "simple" object. Files ending in .hpp
are "complicated" objects or non-objects.
