What it is
----------
  A collection of C++ templates for numerical computation.

Examples of what you might use it for
-------------------------------------
  Linear algebra on arbitrary fields, plane geometry with fixed point
  arithmetic, automatically differentiated FFT output. The combinations
  are endless.

What this is not
----------------
  This code is not meant to be the fastest. The use of templates necessitates
  certain tradeoffs in how numerical algorithms are coded in order to
  accomodate the most types.

  Practical performance and convergence considerations also necessitate
  algorithmic modifications that prevent a fully generic type specialization.
  It is hoped that the balance achieved is simply generally useful.

Unique features
---------------
  * Single file, header-only FFT implementation
  * Templated arbitrary dimensional integration
  * Toeplitz matrix inversion in O(n^2) time
  * Templated BLAS
  * Specialized templates for interfacing to standard numerical packages
  * Automatically differentiated matrix/vector classes

  Unless otherwise specified, all source is under the WTFPL, listed below.
  For example, an exception is the FFT implementation, which was taken from
  Kiss FFT, which has certain source restrictions. The headers do not contain
  this text; I would hope the reason is obvious.
