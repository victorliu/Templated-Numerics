- Move rational class to template on the internal integer representation.
- Move rational_radical classes to template on rational's templating.
- Add preliminary constructible_number class (representation not guaranteed to be unique).
- Add support for triangular views in linear algebra; requires reworking the SFINAE hierarchy.
- Move basic numeric traits to std::numeric_limits<> specializations when possible.
- Add Simpson's method to Integration rules.
- Fix periodic 2D triangulation.
- Finalize TBLAS once and for all, or remove it entirely.
- Add higher precision floating point types.
- Add preliminary level-index type. (http://code.google.com/p/sli-c-library/)
- Add support for symbolic matrix operations (Gaussian elimination, row reduction, etc.).
- Add fixed point types.
- Templated version of zgeev and zggev; nobody cares about real or structured problems; those have been solved to death.
